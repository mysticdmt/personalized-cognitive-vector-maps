Personalized Cognitive Vector Maps
An interdisciplinary approach to intuitive AI-human interaction

What are Cognitive Vector Maps?
Personalized Cognitive Vector Maps are multidimensional visual representations, derived from structured analyses of individual human-AI dialogues. They aim to capture and visually represent human cognitive patterns, logical relationships, conceptual associations, and contextual understanding.

Why This Matters:
By visualizing personal cognitive structures, these maps can act as a "cognitive mirror," helping individuals and researchers explore human cognition in depth, enhance self-awareness, and improve communication with AI.

Potential Applications:

    AI Development: Provide rich, contextually relevant training data to address the natural data shortage.
    Psychology & Cognitive Science: Reveal insights into individual cognitive differences and processes.
    Education: Develop personalized learning experiences tailored to individual cognitive styles.
    Mental Health: Aid therapists and individuals in better understanding personal thought patterns and mental processes.
    Creative Fields: Inspire new forms of artistic and conceptual exploration through intuitive cognitive mapping.

Goals of This Repository:

    Invite collaboration and feedback from AI enthusiasts, developers, psychologists, educators, artists, and researchers.
    Develop prototypes and intuitive interfaces for exploring cognitive maps.
    Establish an open-source community dedicated to expanding the potential of cognitive vector mapping.
